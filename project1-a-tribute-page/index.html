    <li><h4>Devkota used to be so focused while writing that he sometimes did not notice rolling his poems to a cigarette or blowing his nose with them.</h4></li>
    <li><h4>A fervent gambler, Devkota was also a keen harmonium player and spent whole nights playing harmonium.</h4></li>
    <li><h4>Devkota was not poor,but was childishly impractical. Whenever he had money, he searched for numerous ways to spend it. One day he would have a lot of money, and the next day he would sleep hungry.
        A reason for his profligacy could lie in the fact that his wife Man Devi spent a good deal of money in religious activities, which a humanist such as Devkota obviously detested. Thus,he spent the money as far as he could and brought very little money home.
    </h4></li>
    <li><h4>In 1953, when he visited Romania, Devkota brought his blanket, mattress and pillow from home and 
        carried it all the time .Naturally, many people were amazed and curious to see the sight of Devkota carrying his beddings.
    </h4></li>
    <li><h4>At the age of sixteen, he got married with Man devi Chalise.</h4></li>
    <li><h4>Many called the poet a Lunatic when he wrote, "What aim to take, but to fly and touch the moon?" 
        Coincidentally, he died in the  same day the first aircraft to land on the moon, the Soviet Luna-9, reached the moon. </h4></li>
    <li><h4>Brilliant in his studies, Devkota was, at once, promoted from class Eight to Ten in Durbar High School.</h4></li>
    <li><h4>While being treated for his supposed 'insanity' in Ranchi, Dr. Owen Berkeley-Hill said, 'It is a geographical mistake that a talent such as Devkota is born in Nepal. He is not mad, but those of you who are 
        trying to label him insane are mad.'
    </h4></li>
    <li><h4>Devkota was denied the prestigious Madan Puraskar. Actuall, it was feared that Queen Jagadamba - the benefactor of Maddan Puraskar- would grant him a generous patronage in addition to Madan Puraskar if she were
        to know about him and his works. Considerable plots were weaved to keep him out of the Queen's knowledge.
    </h4></li>
    <li class="last"><h4>Devkota seldom acted on his own plans and never made impportant decision himself. A gullible fellow, Devkota suffered the consequences of his crdulity throughout his life</h4></li>
